# Blog Slug TDD Kata

## Specifications

You need to implement a simple `BlogSlug` generator to save a `BlogPost` in the file system as a `.txt` file.

The file name is the slug generated from the `BlogPost` title.

The slug is generated by replacing spaces with hyphens and converting the string to lowercase.

The maximum length of the slug is 10 characters.

The file is filled with the `BlogPost` title and content.

### Exceptions

- If the title is empty, the `BlogSlug` should throw an exception.
- If the file already exists, the slug should be appended with a random number.
